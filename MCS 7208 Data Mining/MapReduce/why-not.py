They get 4 stars because the sound is really good for the price. Nice bass sound and good for canceling out my noisy office during lunch time.~Pros~-Good sound-long cord~Cons~Flimsy construction (they may break with lots of use, I\'m only using during lunch at work and handling gently)Tight on my head (I have a larger head and they are a bit of a pinch)Overall I think they will work great, and I would recommend them for someone in a similar situation as me. I will update this if my thoughts change or it breaks.","AH3ACGYCZI67CSTIUJXTXOTWEGZA","https://www.amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3ACGYCZI67CSTIUJXTXOTWEGZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","Verified Purchase","Panasonic","November 28, 2012","United States",[],0,,,,,,'
